Limit your data to the following. Note that only rows corresponding to a crime have been retained, and I have counted the number of rows (crimes) for each district in each year. I have stored this data frame in an object called  counts
```{r Question 4 Dot Plot }

```


```{r Question 5 Reproduce Table }
